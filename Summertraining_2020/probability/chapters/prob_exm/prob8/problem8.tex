\item An insurance company selected 2000 drivers at random (i.e., without
any preference of one driver over another) in a particular city to find a relationship between age and accidents. The data obtained are given in the following table:\\
\ref{multicolumn_table}
\begin{table}[!ht]
	\centering
	\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
		\hline
		\textbf{Age of drivers} &\multicolumn{5}{c|}{\textbf{Accidents in one year }}\\
		\cline{2-6}
		(in years) &\textbf{0} &\textbf{1} &\textbf{2} &\textbf{3} &\textbf{over 3}\\
		\hline
		18-29 &440 &160 &110 &61 &35\\
		\hline
		30-50 &505 &125 &60 &22 &18\\
		\hline
		Above 50 &360 &45 &35 &15 &9\\
		\hline
	\end{tabular}
	
\end{table}

Find the probabilities of the following events for a driver chosen at random from the city:\\
(i) being 18-29 years of age \textit{and} having exactly 3 accidents in one year.\\
(ii) being 30-50 years of age \textit{and} having one or more accidents in a year.\\
(iii) having no accidents in one year
