\item total no of students = 38
\\
No of students whose weight lie in the range 46-50 = 3\\

probability  of students whose weight lie in the range 46-50 = $P(46<X50)$
\\
\begin{align}
P\left(A\right) &= \frac{3}{38}
\\
&= 0.079
\end{align}
\item
There is no student whose weight is less than 31 kg thus the probability of a student to have the weight less than 31 kg = 0\\

All of the student in this context  have the weight between 31-75 so we can say that the probability of the students to have the weight in the range 31-75 = 1
