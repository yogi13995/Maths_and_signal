\item Total n0 of student = 90
\\
no of students who obtained marks less than $20\%= 7$
\\
assume that P(A) is the probability of the students obtained less than 20$\%$ marks 
\begin{align}
	P\left(A\right) &= \frac{7}{90}
	\\
	&=0.07
\end{align}
\\
\item no of the students obtained 60-70 marks = 15
\\
no of the student obtained 70 above marks = 8
\\
P(B)= probability of a student obtained 60 0r above marks 
\begin{align}
p\left(B\right) &= \frac{15 + 8}{90}
\\
&= 0.256
\end{align}
