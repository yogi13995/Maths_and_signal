\item total no of bages = 5\\
No of bages having 40 germinated seeds = 3\\

probability of a bag having 40 germinated seeds  = P(X=40)
\\
\begin{align}
P\left(X=40\right) &= \frac{3}{5}
\\
&= 0.6
\end{align}

No of bages having 49 germinated seeds = 0\\

probability of a bag having 49 germinated seeds  = P(X=49)
\\
\begin{align}
P\left(X=49\right) &= \frac{0}{5}
\\
&= 0
\end{align}
No of bages having more than 35 germinated seeds = 5\\

probability of a bag having more than 35 germinated seeds  = $P(X>35)$
\
\begin{align}
P\left(X>35\right) &= \frac{5}{5}
\\
&= 1
\end{align}
