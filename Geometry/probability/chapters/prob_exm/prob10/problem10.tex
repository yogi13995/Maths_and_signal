\item Fifty seeds were selected at random from each of 5 bags of seeds, and were kept under standardised conditions favourable to germination. After 20 days, the
number of seeds which had germinated in each collection were counted and recorded as follows:\\

\begin{tabular}{ |c|c|c|c|c|c| } 
	\hline
	\textbf{Bag} &1 &2 &3 \\ 
	\hline
	\textbf{No.of seeds germinated} &40 &48 &42  \\ 
	\hline
	\textbf{Bag} &4 &5&\\ 
	\hline
	\textbf{No.of seeds germinated}  &39 &41& \\ 
	\hline
\end{tabular}\\

What is the probability of germination of
(i)more than 40 seeds in a bag?\\
(ii) 49 seeds in a bag?\\
(iii) more that 35 seeds in a bag?
\end{enumerate}
